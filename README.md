# WordCounter

## Description
The application is used to download data in JSON format from
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and their processing in order to obtain accurate statistics on the number of
the most used words in posts and comments associated with them.

Thanks to the implementation of the INotifyPropertyChanged interface and using the ObservableCollection class, the
application is dynamic, i.e. it does not require the user to reload the data in order to update the statistics
